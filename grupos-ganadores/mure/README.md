# Mure: Share Your Music Taste 🎧 🎶

**Mure**, the winner of the *Berners Lee Award 2024-1* for the UTEC course *Platform-Based Development* (CS2031), is a platform designed for users to share their music preferences with friends and followers. With Mure, you can create and share posts, playlists, and explore music content 🎙️.

The project is developed using **Java and Spring Boot 🌱** for the backend, while the frontend is built with **React ⚛️**, and the mobile application is developed with **React Native 📱**.
